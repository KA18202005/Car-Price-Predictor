# 🚗 Car Price Predictor

An end-to-end **Machine Learning web application** that predicts the **price of a used car** based on user inputs such as company, model, year, fuel type, and kilometers driven.  
The project uses **Flask** for the backend, **scikit-learn** for the ML model, and a **modern glassmorphism UI** for the frontend.
